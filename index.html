		<p>My name is Greg and I'm currently doing this course to advance my digital skills and to hopefully put them to use in the future. I am still only 20 years old and believe that this is a useful course for me to get an insight into the tech industry and some of the different roles within the industry. I enjoy adventourous activities such as learning new cultures or visiting and experiencing new countries. Residing from Trowbridge I went to St Laurence School in Bradford-On-Avon, it was at this school I spent six years and it was here that I took an interest in business. This interest in business is one of the reasons I took this course as I thought it would be useful to know how to market myself/business digitally and how to create a functioning website for any future business venture. Although I have no experience in the tech industry I am hoping this course allows me to get an insight and to develop a basic understanding of the different sectors of the course such as Digital Marketing, UX/UI design and Web Development. </p>
